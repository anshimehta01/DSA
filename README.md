# DSA Daily Practice (C++ - LeetCode)

This repository contains my **daily practice solutions** for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) from **LeetCode**, solved in **C++**.  
The goal is to solve at least **one problem every day** to improve problem-solving skills and maintain coding consistency.

## ðŸ“… Daily Log

| Day | Problem | Complexity |
|-----|----------|------------|
| 1   | Leaders in Array | Time Complexity: O(n) and Space Complexity: O(n)|
| 2   | longest_consecutive_sequence | Time Complexity: O(n) average, O(nÂ²) worst case and Space Complexity: O(n)|
| 3   | NextPermutation | Time Complexity: O(n) and Space Complexity: O(1)|
| 4   | Rotate_matrixby90degrees | Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) and Space Complexity: O(1)
| 5   | setmatrixzeroes | Time Complexity: O(n Ã— m) and Space Complexity: O(1)
| 6   | spiraltraverselofmatrix | Time Complexity: O(n Ã— m) and Space Complexity: O(n Ã— m) (O(1) extra space, excluding output)
